	  "and sulfur ore; and chopping down trees provides wood. To survive in the world, the player must gather resources and use them to craft tools, weapons, and other gear. To craft items, the" +
	  "player must have a sufficient amount of all required materials, with advanced items needing more obscure components scattered around the map. There are limitations imposed on the amount " +
	  "of craftable items, with blueprints allowing the creation of more advanced items. An important element in Rust is the airdrop. These are parachute-equipped pallets of supplies delivered " +
	  "by a prop plane. They can be seen over extremely long distances, sometimes resulting in players running towards the airdrop. There are also other entities that drop advanced loot, including an " +
	  "attack helicopter and the CH-47 Chinook. These travel to a random zone on the map, attempt to kill players, and then drop a supply crate that opens after a length of time, inviting PvP " +
	  "interactions. There are player-operable vehicles in Rust. Boats are used to traverse long distances across water and reach valuable loot. Hot air balloons can also be used to explore the map " +
	  "quickly. Spawning randomly, they can be used once fueled. Unlike the helicopters, balloons can be destroyed by surface-to-air missiles that players can position outside bases. " ;

function Third(){

	"hypothermia, and wildlife attacks—primarily bears and wolves. Specific locales around the map are radioactive. There are four levels of radiation: minor, low, medium, and high. The correct armour " +
	"or clothing must be worn to enter these areas; failure to do so can result in death. Upon death, a screen with an option to respawn at a random location or at a sleeping bag placed prior appears. " +
	"Respawning resets the player's inventory to the basic rock and torch. The main concept of Rust is to form a clan. Clans usually create housing for their members, give items and supplies to each " +
	"other and partake in organised raiding and looting. Safe zones, called Compounds, provide players with a place to trade resources, overlooked by automated high-damage turrets that fire on anyone " +
	"who draws a weapon, discouraging betrayal. Additionally, these treacherous players will be marked as hostile for a predetermined amount of time." ;
